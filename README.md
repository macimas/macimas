# The Guy Who Did It

Some guy named Steve said “I should go to a eating contest so i can have a new **iPhone** X that Apple created.”, And so he did.

He signed up for the application.
All of the people who signed for the eating contest got to a meeting with the host of the eating contest.
The host of the eating contest said “Alright people, This eating contest is about to start next month, It will take place in New York. Also remember to exercise so you can be all ready.  And please be there at 10:00 AM. We don’t accept laties..”.

And so he did.

Now… it’s time where it really gets **real**. (next month later)

When he was driving from Arizona to New York, he found 2 jet planes going to New York.
He was confused but he continued to drive to New York.

1 hour later…

He got to New York and he found that the streets were blocked with tons of cars. He waited a bit until he released there were no people inside the cars. He got out and found no people walking in the sidewalk. He was very confused. So he yelled for help.

But instead of hearing someone...
He heard a crash from the World Trade Center.

He was shocked. Full of fear. He ran and ran and ran until he din’t hear anything.
After that, he found the eating contest that was held. But…
There were no people…
He was full of stress. And he silently slept into a coma…

The End.
